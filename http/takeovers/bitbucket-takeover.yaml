  name: Bitbucket Takeover Detection
  author: pdteam
  severity: high
  description: |
    A Bitbucket takeover occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized control of a Bitbucket repository.
    It could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive source code repositories, potential data breaches, intellectual property theft, and reputational damage to the affected organization
  remediation: To remediate the Bitbucket takeover vulnerability, users should review and manage repositories, enforce strong passwords and 2FA, grant minimal access permissions, and monitor activity.
