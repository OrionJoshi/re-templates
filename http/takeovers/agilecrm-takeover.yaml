  name: AgileCRM Subdomain Takeover Detection
  author: pdteam
  severity: high
  description: |
    It involves the potential for attackers to take control of unused subdomains within the AgileCRM platform.
    An attacker can claim and control the victimâ€™s subdomain if this vulnerability is successfully exploited and could lead to reputational damage, financial loss, and potential legal consequences.
  remediation: Conduct regular scans to identify subdomains within the AgileCRM platform that are inactive and reclaim or remove control of these subdomains by updating DNS records or server configurations to prevent unauthorized access
