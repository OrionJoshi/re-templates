  author: pdteam
  severity: high
  description: |
    This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially hijack unused subdomains within the Aftership platform. 
    An attacker could host malicious content, such as phishing pages on the compromised subdomain, and trick users into revealing personal information.
  remediation: Conduct regular scans to find unused or inactive subdomains within the Aftership platform and reclaim control of these subdomains by updating DNS records or server configurations to prevent unauthorized access.
